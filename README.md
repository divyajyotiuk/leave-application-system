# wtl-project

to run do the following:

- cd public
- parcel *.html
- once it builds, then just do ctrl+C
- do firebase serve

So then you could test your code

if you face problems once you pull this repo again then use this command: ```firebase use --add```
add your alias and you can start working.

Cheerio!
