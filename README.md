# Leave Application System

### Create a firebase web project and add the config


To run do the following:

Open 2 terminals(tabs also fine):
- first `npm install`
- run command `npm run start` on one (don't forget to set the env vars)
- run command `npm run parcel-dev` on another (it's a watcher for you to tweak with the app and see your changes come live)

Cheerio!
